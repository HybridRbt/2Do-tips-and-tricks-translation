## 高级搜索

[Advanced Search](https://www.2doapp.com/advanced-search/)

2Do boasts the most powerful search engine on the App Store. Combined with the power of dynamic Smart Lists (a.k.a Saved Searsches) you can create highly specific filters that match your needs.

2Do 可以说拥有 App Store 同类 app 中最强大的搜索引擎。结合动态智能列表，（即 收藏的搜索）你可以根据你的需求创建非常具体的过滤器。

### Searching for Actions, Task Types, & Task Attributes

### 搜索动作，任务类型和任务属性

You can use any of the following reserved search keywords (without quotes) to filter on specific tasks. This is extremely useful when combined with dynamic Smart Search Lists. You could, for example, create a smart list on the term ‘type:audio’ and quickly navigate to all tasks with Audio notes without hunting through a long list (and without the need of changing sort options).

你可以使用下列任一搜索关键词（不带引号）来筛选出具体的任务。这一功能搭配动态智能列表格外有用。比如，你可以根据关键词 “type:audio” （类型：音频）来创建一个智能列表，它可以让你快速找出所有备注中包含音频的任务，而不用在一个长长的列表中搜寻（也不需要改变排序选项）。

- “type: action” – will return all tasks with any action set
- “type: call” – will return all tasks with a Call action
- “type: sms” – will return all tasks with a SMS action
- “type: email” – will return all tasks with an Email action
- “type: browse” – will return all tasks with a URL action
- “type: visit” – will return all tasks with a Visit action
- “type: google” – will return all tasks with a Google Search action


- “type: audio” – will return all tasks with an Audio file
- “type: pict” – will return all tasks with a Picture attachment
- “type: note” – will return all tasks with notes


- “type: proj” – will return all projects
- “type: chck” – will return all checklists
- “type: task” – will return all tasks (not checklists or projects)


- “type: hiprio” – will return all high-priority tasks
- “type: medprio” – will return all medium-priority tasks
- “type: lowprio” – will return all low-priority tasks


- “type: repeat” – will return all recurring tasks
- “type: overdue” – will return all overdue tasks
- “type: tomorrow” – will return all tasks due tomorrow
- “type: today” – will return all tasks due today
- “type: donetoday” will return all tasks that were completed today

### Searching for Tags

To look for tasks with the tags ‘home’ and ‘work’, you can type the following in the search field:

```
tags: home, work
```

To filter on all tasks that have at least one tag set, type the following:

```
tags: ?
```

Or to filter on all tasks without tags, you would type:
tags: ~

### Soundex

The Soundex Search capability of 2Do is perhaps the most understated, probably because no other application offers anything like it.

When taking notes, synchronizing tasks from an external source, or adding quick ToDos, one doesn’t always remember how one spelled a particular name, a place or the not-so-obvious spelling mistakes one made. That should be the least of one’s worries.

Thankfully with Soundex (which is ON by default and can be switched OFF) you don’t need to worry about all this when searching through your tasks. Soundex matches on similar sounding words (thus the name), which is what you want when looking through ToDos and their associated Notes, Tags etc.
